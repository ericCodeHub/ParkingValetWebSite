Parking Valet Web Application

This is a full-service parking valet web application using ASP.NET, node.js, and vue.js.  Users can create customer accounts, login as customers, and login as valets.  Customers can view their car details on an electronic valet slips, see lot details, and request a car pickup.  Valets can view car details, check cars in and out, and view available spots.

It is based on the final capstone for Tech Elevator.  It has been updated since then.
